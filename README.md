# Triple-LED-Control-with-Pushbuttons
This project uses an Arduino Uno to control three LEDs using three separate pushbuttons. Each button turns on its corresponding LED when pressed. The project demonstrates how to read digital inputs and control digital outputs using Arduino, making it a great beginner-friendly electronics and programming exercise.
